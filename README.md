### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Arthur Alves.

I live in The Netherlands ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±, originally from Brazil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·

I could describe myself as Mobile and macOS Engineer with a strong passion for automation, tooling, open source, FRP and other cool stuff you hear nowadays. This space is especially for my projects and software development.

Besides coding I do love football âš½, video games ðŸŽ® and many other things, so follow me on social media if youâ€™d like to connect.

### Open Source
Iâ€™ve always wanted to be more active in the open source community, but you know, the old "I don't have time for it right now" excuse kept me away for too long. Not anymore! Be sure you follow me on Github ðŸš€

### Gaming Industry
Iâ€™m venturing myself in game development, slowly but surely building a story driven RPG for console. It will take years. Check that work on Redslash.

### What I do for a living?
Currently iOS Engineer at ðŸ‘‰ [@Vinted](https://www.vinted.com)

Previously, Mobile Tech Lead at [@Backbase](https://github.com/Backbase)
